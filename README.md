# Data-Visualization-Course-Project
 
## Milestone 1: Team Project- Progress Report
 
### Goal of the project: 
Our goal is to help UVW University help them identify suitable candidates for the target population by using the $50,000 income threshold, 
thereby increasing their enrollment rate. Therefore, we made a data analysis and deployed machine learning and AI technology on the US adult 
census data to determine which features have the greatest impact on personal income, and the correlation between these features and income. 
We will apply several classification methods to predict the person’s income by inputting the person’s most important characteristics. Our 
purpose is to help UVW College to increase the number of enrollment by helping UVW College identify suitable individuals for the target 
population by using the following methods.Therefore, we conducted data analysis and deployed machine learning and AI technology on the US 
adult census data to determine which features have the greatest impact on personal income, and the correlation between these features and income.
